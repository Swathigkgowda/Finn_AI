# Finn_AI
Class Name: TestFinnAI(src)
Description:
- Class has 5 testmethods used for testing 5 different google query sting. 
- Each method takes query string as a parameter and open bing search engine to search the query string. 
- Control will then pick up the first bing result and compare the domain with '.finn.ai'.
- Every method has assert which will check for desired domain. I have used testng.xml file to provide input parameters for each method.
- Also I have used TestNg framework for reporting the test result. 'mailable-report.html' can be referred for test results. 

- TestNG file name - testing.xml (This has five search string specified as a parameter, as specified in the question) 
- TestNG Report file - mailable-report.html
